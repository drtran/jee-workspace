Feature: Getting Customer Information
    As a partner application, 
    I want to get information of a customer by a customer ID
    So that, I can send promotion information to that customer.
    
  Scenario Outline: Getting a customer record by a given customer ID
    Given that a customer exists with "<customer_id>", "<company_name>", "<contact_name>", "<contact_title>", and "<phone>"
    When I call MongoRS service with a given "<customer_id>"
    Then I should receive a customer record with "<customer_id>", "<company_name>", "<contact_name>", "<contact_title>", and "<phone>"
    
    Examples:
      | customer_id | company_name       | contact_name   | contact_title | phone          |
